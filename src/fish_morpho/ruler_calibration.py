"""Ruler detection and pixels-per-millimeter calibration.

Each specimen photo contains a metric ruler laid next to the fish. We need to
convert pixel distances into millimeters, so this module exposes two things:

  1. ``detect_ruler_scale`` — an OpenCV-based detector that tries to find the
     ruler automatically, identify tick marks along one of its long edges,
     and return a pixels-per-mm factor.
  2. ``scale_from_known_span`` — a deterministic fallback used when a human
     (or a JSON annotation file) provides two points and the real-world
     distance between them. This is always available and is what the
     pipeline uses when ``--mode manual`` is passed or when auto-detection
     fails.

The frontal-view mirror ruler is smaller and oriented perpendicular to the
main ruler, but the algorithm is identical — we just run it on the mirror
region of interest.

Design notes
------------
* We do not require a specific ruler brand or colour. The detector works on
  the assumption that the ruler is the dominant straight, high-contrast,
  elongated object in its ROI and that its tick marks are a regular 1D
  pattern perpendicular to its long axis.
* Tick spacing is recovered via an FFT-based peak in the 1D intensity
  profile along the ruler's long axis. This is more robust than finding
  every individual tick (which tends to fail for faint sub-cm marks and
  over-count when numerals are printed on the ruler).
* The detector returns a ``CalibrationResult`` that includes a ``confidence``
  score and the intermediate artifacts (ROI, profile, detected period in
  pixels) so the caller can decide to fall back to manual calibration.
* We do not depend on a specific OpenCV build at import time; the heavy
  ``cv2`` import is deferred into functions that need it. This keeps unit
  tests that only exercise ``scale_from_known_span`` lightweight.
