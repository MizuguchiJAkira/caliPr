"""Annotation schema for brook trout morphometrics.

This module is the single source of truth for the ML model's output
contract: which polygons, which keypoints, and which named reference
lines an annotated fish image must carry in order to compute all 22
MorFishJ traits plus our extras. The same declarations feed:

  * the CVAT / Label Studio project config (so labelers see exactly the
    shapes the measurement engine expects, no more and no less),
  * the measurement engine's input validation,
  * the labeling guide that ships with the data README.

Three shape types live here:

1. **Polygons** — closed point sequences tracing fin and body outlines.
   Five of them: ``body_plus_caudal``, ``pectoral``, and the three
   extras ``dorsal``, ``pelvic``, ``anal``. The body+caudal polygon is
   split at line A (narrowest peduncle) by the measurement engine into
   "body" and "caudal" halves, matching MorFishJ's convention.

2. **Keypoints** — single ``(x, y)`` clicks for anatomical landmarks
   (eye cardinals, premaxilla tip, mouth corner, pectoral insertion,
   etc.) plus the endpoints for line A (narrowest peduncle) and the
   anchor points for lines H (caudal fin base) and I (posterior
   operculum). Two frontal keypoints (``mouth_left``, ``mouth_right``)
   live in the mirror view for mouth width.

3. **Reference lines** — named horizontal or vertical construction
   lines MorFishJ uses to define its measurements. Three are
   user-provided via keypoints: A (from the two peduncle-narrowest
   keypoints), H (vertical through ``caudal_base``), I (vertical
   through ``operculum_posterior``). Nine are derived by the engine at
   measurement time: B/C (dorsal/ventral body extrema), D/E (anterior
   body / posterior caudal extrema), F/G (dorsal/ventral caudal
   extrema), J/K (horizontal/vertical through eye centroid), L
   (vertical through ``pectoral_insertion_upper``).

Orientation convention
----------------------
All lateral photos must have the fish **facing left** (head toward the
smaller x values). If a photo has the head pointing right, rotate it
180° before labeling. This is the same convention MorFishJ's "Fish
facing left or right" step handles in its GUI; we enforce it as a
pre-labeling step instead.

Coordinate convention
---------------------
Pixel space, +x to the right, +y downward (standard OpenCV / image
processing). "Highest body edge" in the MorFishJ manual means visually
highest = smallest y; "lowest body edge" = largest y.

Trait source
------------
Every trait declares whether it comes from MorFishJ (22 of them) or
from our extras (8 of them, pending full anatomical definitions from
the Cornell reference sheets). Extras carry a reference-sheet number so
the export column order can group them alongside the existing manual
workflow.

#: it to k of its own real vertices loses 26% of the area at k=5, 13% at k=7,
#: 9% at k=9, 5% at k=16, 2% at k=24. Fins curve far harder per unit size, so
#: those figures are a floor for them, not an estimate.
#:
#: 16 is where the body's loss falls to ~5%; below it the bias is large enough
#: to move a fin-area trait more than the between-specimen signal does. It also
#: shows up directly in the data — size-corrected fin area correlates with
#: vertex count on every fin (pelvic r = +0.57), which it should not do if the
#: tracings were dense enough to be measuring the fin rather than the clicking.
